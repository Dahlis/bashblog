Bashblog
========
Slightly modified script with personal touch.  
For more information about the script, please visit [Carlos Fenollosa's](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) Github.

Things that have been changed:
--------

- Disabled the create_css, haven't change them yet.
- Added the CSS files to Github instead.
- Changed &lt;hr&gt; to &lt;readmore&gt; for "Read more", easier to remember (personal touch).
